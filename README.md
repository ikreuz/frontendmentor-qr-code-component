## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I consider that I learned how to design a component, based on certain predefined requirements. I consider that these challenges are important, since instead of a component you can think of a web page that must be designed following this learning vector.

I establish a container as the main structure

```html
 <div class="container"></div>
```

followed by a main content with main tag

```html
 <main class="main-content" role="main"></main>
```

and finally a letter with tag article

```html
<article class="card" role="article"></article>
```
